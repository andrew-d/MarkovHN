Small oil spills are almost harmless.  So are small quantities of sparks.  The combination of small oil spills and small quantities of sparks, however, is a severe problem and gets worse in a hurry if it compounds with certain other usually benign properties of nuclear power plants.Unfortunately, the sort of nuclear power plant operators which tolerate oil spills are often sufficiently not on their A game to tolerate sparks.This is a very handwavy explanation.  In particular, God doesn't hate nuclear powerplants and try to introduce sparks into them at inopportune moments just to see if they happen to find an oil spill, but The Adversary often can and will do this to your cryptosystem.", "At the risk of unsolicited dating advice: is the reason one is embarassed to mention one's occupation to a woman at the bar caused by tech salaries being too high, or by years of social conditioning telling you that geeks are low status?

Possible Xes include \"helped teach  Y00,000 kids to read last year\", \"gets patients in to see their doctors\", or \"makes shedloads of money for software companies like Y\" if they look like they swing that way.You'll note the pointed absence of \"I am a poor peon working in the Ruby on Rails salt mines.\"  (And heck, even when I was a Japanese salaryman, I got better results with \"I am in charge of administration of X university's admissions exam\" rather than \"I write unit tests and XML files, please tune out of this conversation.\")", "Can you describe that in terms of an important system, somewhere, which would not exist but for your contributions?

There are various procedural safeguards which you'll need, the absence of which will make any technical safeguards irrelevant from a compliance perspective.  For example, one of the requirements is that you have a nominated HIPAA officer, another is that you have a written policy to discipline employees who abuse patient health information.  You need both of these things regardless of whether your host makes certain aspects of compliance with the Security Rule easier.About those things: HIPAA was apparently drafted by Congressional aides, not by technologists, so the Security Rule establishes a bunch of checkboxes which have eff all relevance to my main concerns as a systems engineer about application security.For example, HIPAA and the assorted guidance is, as far as I know, totally silent on what this:Do you have procedures for creating, changing, and safeguarding passwords?actually means when the bcrypt hits the road.  I'm pretty sure that \"Yes, we do.  We enforce 8 character maximum passwords, they have to be changed every 3 weeks and 1 day except when the anniversary date falls on a Tuesday, and they are secured in our database by ROT13, an advanced encryption technology.\" is facially compliant as long as you have written it down somewhere.  There is very little in terms of either best practices or safe harbors.This is a long way to say that you probably can't take an application and HIPAA-ify it by writing a check to a hosting provider.Given that you have the procedural and technical safeguards in place, I'm personally of the opinion (and feel free to check with your lawyer) that the right words, procedures, and application-level security features make it possible to host HIPAA-compliant applications on most common cloud providers.I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice, yadda yadda.", "We are now approaching the territory of \"Seemingly simple questions it is maddeningly difficult to get a straight answer on\", but I have discussed this with multiple lawyers, often experts at HIPAA under the employ of enterprise clients, and \"You don't own the hardware?\" has never been a dealbreaker for them.YMMV.

They did genuinely own 100% at that time.  Then as they raised the 300k they issued additional shares, at valuations between $0.50 and $4, diluting the founders horribly, because the founders did not award themselves new shares.The fundamental problem here is grossly misvaluing the company (i.e. the total value of 100% of the shares) at the time new shares were issued.  For example, if you had hypothetically bought them a drafting table for $100 (an example used later), you ended up with a 0.5% stake in the company (implicitly valuing the company at $2k at that point).  A tech company which only exists as a napkin held between two hungry young men with no asset other than a gleam in their eye gets a notional value of $250k+ on day one.  If you attempt to invest in them later, after they have e.g. a product with customers for it, the value gets re-pegged SHARPLY north of that, perhaps in the single digit millions or higher if they're doing really well.He mentions that a lot of the money men involved were annoyed by hordes of small investors making seemingly outsized returns on their initial investments.  I don't think he quiiiiite understands that they're not wrong: their outsized returns were essentially large gifts of surplus value from the founders to them.

Also, as your client has lower perception of project risk and execution risk, their perception of the probable magnitude of the success for your engagement will likely increase.

Given a functioning Rails application and told to put it on the Internet, and assuming you're a competent systems engineer, allocating an afternoon to the project is not a bad idea at all.  (Unless you already have made the upfront investment in e.g. Chef/Puppet/etc scripts to configure everything your app will need to get running.  I have a project where I haven't, but I've got pretty good documentation on what needs to be done to bring up the whole environment, and it takes me 2 to 3 hours to do.)+ Programmers are rare.  Programmers close to your are rarer.  Programmers close to you willing to work for what you're willing to pay are rarer still.  Yadda yadda.  All of this is true about PHP programmers but they're about an order of magnitude or two more common than e.g. Rails programmers.+ Even if we concede that PHP is a language comparable to duct tape and bubblegum, I've got to point out that a lot of the world just needs duct tape and bubblegum.  There is a web service running at my old day job, where hitting a URL is supposed to tell you when the most current backup of the database was taken, and that's it.  It is written in PHP and was coded, tested, and deployed live in approximately as much time as writing this comment took.  Rails -- which I love! -- is not a very good hammer to hit that nail with.  (I've got an app or two on Sinatra internally, and while I like them, they feel inferior in this case to \"We already have Apache up.  Copy/paste one file and forget this was ever a task.\")", "Consider it the creative application of computer code to systemic weaknesses in the global economy, with a clearly defined success function which is fairly difficult to fudge.  That might help explain some of the attraction.  (There's also the \"If you only know W-2 employees, then making money by a legitimate means other than a day job feels like cheating\", and for some reason a lot of hackers like winning by rules exploitation more than they like winning.)", "Some options:1)  Do you have freelancing or other experience which has exposed you to multiple people with similar problems?  For example, have you implemented the same \"$()#% authentication system for a web application 20 times?  Package up that one little piece of the puzzle into a scalable way to teach people to do it without needing to have you or someone similarly skilled on their team.  Common form factors include ebooks.  Sell the ebook.  If you want to sell lots of the ebook, start by offering some free incentive to get people to trade you their email address, then send them email about $TOPIC for a while to make them trust you as an authority on it, then ask them to buy your thing.  (Note: You don't have to be the world's leading expert on building authentication systems.  You've just taken somebody's shilling to do it twenty times, which means that it is likely much, much cheaper for somebody to buy your thing and hand it to his junior developer than it is to pay a similarly-experienced engineer to do that part of the system.)2)  Failing that, talk to businesses.  I could give you a vague fact pattern to ask about (a problem which is amenable to a solution with code) but people seem to get hung up on that so I'll give you something really specific: you are looking for a MS Excel spreadsheet which has ever been mailed by Bob to Cindy, had Cindy edit it, and mail it back to Bob.  Every time this happens a SaaS app gets its wings.  Now go out and find, in the actual physical world, ten firms which have that same darn spreadsheet.  Offer to build them a software system which solves the business problem which that spreadsheet represents.  Ask if they would pay (pick a number based on how big the firm is) $50 to $250 a month for it.  If yes, ask them to commit to buying it when it is ready.  If you get 5 commits, build it, sell to them (n.b. you'll lose some commits here), and then start trying to sell it in more scalable Internet-y ways.3)  Failing that, Bingo Card Creator, an app which does everything wrong in terms of business model and market selection, sold ~$1k a month something like 6 months after launch just because I got halfway decent at organic SEO.  If you're willing to get good at one generalizable acquisition strategy (SEO, Facebook ads, AdWords, etc etc), with that wind behind you even turkeys can fly.  (It often turns out that there are more lucrative options than pushing turkeys around.)4)  Find or create one proprietary data source which is not currently exposed to Google which answers a question that demonstrates commercial intent.  Expose that proprietary data source to Google.  The federal government has approximately 100,000 CSV files of interesting data which are not helpful to someone asking questions like (not a good example site, but a great example of there-is-an-answer-to-this-buried-in-a-free-CSV) \"What is the median salary of mid-career dentists in Topeka, Kansas?\"How you monetize a site like that depends on the specifics of the niche and how savvy you are about it.  Lead generation is very lucrative, if the question you're answering tends to suggest near-term commercial intent in something with a liquid market.  If you want to make a lot less money in a braindead simple fashion, just slap adsense on it.Also, I think I alluded to this above, but anybody capable of executing on any of these has ipso facto developed skills which can be employed by Real Companies with Real Budgets to make hundreds of thousands of dollars in marginal revenue.  I know you said you want passive options but more active options, like selling consulting, are things that might well fit where you are in life a few years down the road.", "I think it would be challenging to duplicate Patrick's extremely low-cost and synergistic SEO strategy with a SAAS offering that was not so text-centric.Many people have reported to me that variations on it have worked out quite well for them.

Let's see, scroll down a few results...ftp://ftp.cfda.gov/datagov/programs-full-datagov.csvThat's a full listing of government programs which are designed to give people money.  You could transform that opaque, disorganized CSV file into an easier-to-consume .org site to educate people on how to apply for government grants, right?  And you could run ads on that site, right?  (I think it is likely that the type of ads you'll get on that specific site would be scummy as heck, but there's another 75,000 CSV files listed on data.gov, so do a bit more searching and find a better one.)1b)  Assuming you have picked good questions to answer, you monetize by connecting people who have demonstrable interest in spending money to people they can spend that money with.  That could be directly with you, if you have a product which answers their needs.  It could be with other folks, via selling leads.  It could just be with Big Daddy G, by putting AdSense on the site, bankrolled by people who have the business model that you haven't implemented yet.2)  I actually wound down the consulting business.

What's your estimate on the mean number of Facebook groups created by fawning fangirls they each have?", "I agree with the conclusion, but the even more wildly actionable information is that you can decrease CS costs and increase customer happiness by using copywriting better than \"That email and password do not match our records.\"  (Also, as a product owner with an engineering background, I have to come  down on the \"In this case, prefer UX over security\" side of the debate, since there are numerous other options for divining existence of an account/email address and refusing to tell the account owner that gets you no marginal security benefit but does frustrate their use of your system.)", "After having said something out-of-school ~10 years ago as \"patio11\" on a forum and having someone track that down via not-so-difficult Googling (since I use \"patio11\" approximately everywhere), I resolved to eliminate the ambiguity and assume that anything I post under any patio11 account goes on my permanent record.  Ironically, while it certainly didn't feel like it at the time, this was probably a net win for everyone, since I'm a much more pleasant person to be around on the Internet these days and my Internet reputation has been frequently useful professionally.", "For anyone who thinks death from overwork merits scare quotes: I really, really can't recommend becoming a salaryman, but it would change your mind.", "If you produce meaningful business value in 2~4 hours, just charge for the day.

After you've made that decision, adding a marginal passenger is much, much, MUCH cheaper than the price of a ticket.  The margins approach that of the last customer added to a SaaS company.  (!)Airlines occasionally obscure this with regards to their public pricing rationales for extra luggage, but that is almost solely an ops/revenue-maximization problem for the airline rather than being sincerely a proportional response to the additional marginal cost of putting another bag in the air.", "The prevailing theory among air carriers is that demand for flights is totally exogenous to the industry and allocation of flights between carriers in the industry is, for most customers (e.g. not frequent business travelers, who are price insensitive and care about mileage), dependent pretty much solely on price.  Accordingly, minor decreases in comfort which add capacity are pretty much an auto-win.Many people dislike this conclusion and dispute it's factual accuracy because they don't want to believe that they'll predictably increase their own agony to shave $5 off a ticket.
